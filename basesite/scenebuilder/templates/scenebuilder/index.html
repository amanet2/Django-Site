<h2>Game Engine Details</h2>
<ul>
    <p>
        Game-Engine-Red is a simple 2D game maker
        written in Java.  Due to the mapfile-based
        design of the engine, various languages and
        technologies can be utilized to design maps
        for the engine to play.
        <br>
        Launch in editor mode to experiment with maps
        and scales as you have full start/stop control
        of the gameplay while your camera remains unaffected.
        <br>
        When you are ready, you can design a static map that
        can be loaded and played as a standardized game experience.
        <br>
        Comes with a few templates, and is currently configured
        for the top-down demo.  All customization to the engine
        can be done in the C_* files and the I_* files, prefixes
        which stand for Custom and Input respectively.
